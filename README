== Welcome to Live Goals

Live Goals is an application, written in Ruby on Rails, that shows the live soccer games.

It is a university project developed to the Multimedia I in the Computer Engeneering course. The main idea was create a multimedia application, but the result was a db oriented application.

Despite the name, Live Goals, this application needs a person to introduce the data about the active games. Would be great if the newspaper make available some APIs or even a feed to be used by the other system. But they seem to don't work that way.

The only "live" data in the application is the news provided by Google News.

Actually, this application looks very similar to any other live score website already available. Even the videos are linked to sapo.pt.

Maybe in the future, hoping that the newspapers provide an API, it can become a real live application with all data coming from other sites. It would be a nice start to make it work automaticaly and the players/teams stats being updated after the game.

Feel free to use, modify and play around. Just don't forget to put the author's name ;)
